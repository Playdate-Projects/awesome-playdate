## Ports
Ports. Whether it's a port of [DOOM](https://github.com/chocolate-doom/chocolate-doom), often one of the first ports made to a new console, or a port of a programming language, every console has one. So here are some awesome ports!

- [Rust for Playdate](https://github.com/pd-rs/crankstart): A pretty awesome port of Rust to Playdate!
- [Rust for Playdate... Again?](https://github.com/igaryhe/playdate-rs): Apparently there's another one!
- [Playnote Studio](https://github.com/jaames/playnote-studio): A viewer for the files produced by the pretty awesome Flipnote Studio!

## Games
Games are the most important part of a game console! Let's take a look at some awesome games!
- [Playdate Party Parrot](https://github.com/jmhobbs/Playdate-Party-Parrot): This... this is beautiful. Turn the crank to see the Party Parrot party!
